# Welcome to my first User Centric Frontend Development Project

For my Milestone Project 1 on Code Institute's Diploma in Software Developement course I have created a website for a sofa company. SnuggleZone is a company which specialises in making chic and comfortable sofas.

## Project Goals

### Who is this website for?
SnuggleZone aims to target individuals who are ready to invest in their home with a chic, elegant but simple sofa. I have therefore aimed to create a website which runs smoothly and is visually appealing but simple. 

### What does this website do?
This website will advertise sofa products and enable customers to get in touch and request a fitting, after which they will be able to purchase a product.

### User Stories
The customer base that I will aim to attract with to this website are:
* UK based, as this is the first website for a small company.
* Family
