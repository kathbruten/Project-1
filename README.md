# Welcome to my first User Centric Frontend Development Project


## Project goals
In making this project, my goal was to create a website for a bespoke table company which would offer a logical and enjoyable user experience, and create the base for a successful business website.

## Developer and business goals
Designer goals are to create a website which runs smoothly, is efficient, visually appealling and helpful
Business goals are to create a user experience which will deliver the company's brand of luxurious and beautiful bespoke tables that are enjoyable, durable, practical and beautiful.

## User stories (customer goals)
The customer base that I will aim to attract with to this website are:
* UK based, as this is the first website for a small company.
* Family orientated people who have spent more time at home throughout the past few years and are ready to invest in a beautiful table which will help them enjoy being at home, and also encourage them to make use of their gardens and get outside.
* Invidivuals who enjoy being outside, specifically eating outside, and want to make the most of their gardens - offering that element of escapism in the Summer with the Meditaranian design, while also being durable enough to last many British winters without need for concern.
* 30s - 60s in age
